# Lending Club Case Study
Assigment by Upgrad and IIIT-B
> The case study concentrates on exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify the key parameters that indicate whether a customer is likely to default on a loan. I commissioned a PowerPoint presentation to illustrate the main factors to consider when issuing loans, along with their data distributions.
